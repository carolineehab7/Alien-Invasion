# Alien-Invasion
The whispers have become shouts, the blurry figures in the night sky, confirmed
spaceships. An alien invasion is no longer science fiction !!! The world needs to act quickly to
be ready for the expected invasion. Using the observed information about alien armies, The
Global Defense Unit decided to make the world ready by simulating Earth's power against
aliens' power.

So it's time to choose: simulate or surrender. 
In this project, we used data structures.
